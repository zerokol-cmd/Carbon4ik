unrestricted pentesting tool for roblox studio

features:
- semi-automatic offset updates ( lua api update is fully automatic, while ABI has to be maintained by you )
- ability to run code in any created vm
- additional unconventional functions that might help during debugging or reversing like "debugbreak()"

currently broken due to the radical changes in ABI and lua.

rember to attach debugger to roblox and then do injection if you want to debug dll

how to build: 
- msvc ONLY
- spam "build all" until no errors will appear (thanks msvc)
